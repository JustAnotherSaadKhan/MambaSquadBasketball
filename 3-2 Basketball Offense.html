    <h1>3-2 Basketball Offense
    </h1>

    <p class="p1" style="margin-top: 20px">For as long as there have been designed offenses, the 3-2 formation has been around. Putting our point guard up top,
        our shooting guard and small forward on the wings, and the power forward and center down on the block, we maintain
        good spacing around the outside of the court while also maintaining a presence inside for post scoring and offensive
        rebounding opportunities.</p>

    <div style="margin-top: 50px">
        <img src="32formation.jpg" style="float:right;">
        <p class="p1">The 3-2 offense is best suited to a team with players who match their positions most traditional descriptions - a
            pass first point guard, wing players with good range and ball handling abilities, and bigs who are most comfortable
            with their back to the basket, down on the low block.</p>
        <p class="p1">For this, and all other offenses, it's important to put your players in the best position to succeed. Your three
            outside players should be interchangeable, and should know the responsibilities of both the point guard, shooting
            guard and small forward for each play. That goes the same for both the center and power forward.</p>

    <div style="margin-top: 10%">
        <h1>3 Out 2 In Pick and Roll Offense</h1>
        <p class="p1">The point guard will hit the shooting guard on the right wing and then follow the ball, cutting through to the strong
            corner.
        </p>

        <center>
            <img src="32pnr1.jpg" width="25%">
        </center>
        <p class="p1">The center will next come up to set an inside ball screen for the two-guard, rolling to the baseline as the shooting
            guard penetrates into the paint. The point guard will lift, coming up to the wing out of the corner.</p>
        <center>
            <img src="32pnr2.jpg" width="25%">
        </center>
        <p class="p1">If the shooting guard doesn't have his first or second looks, he can hit the small forward spotting up on the left
            wing and continue all the way through to the left corner.</p>
        <center>
            <img src="32pnr3.jpg" width="25%">
        </center>
        <p class="p1">Again, our ball side big man is going to come up and set a pick on the inside, from which the small forward can penetrate
            and look to score, hit a big man with a dump off pass, or kick it out to a shooter on the wing.</p>
        <center>
            <img src="32pnr4.jpg" width="25%">
        </center>
        <p class="p1">This is a continuous set, meaning if you don't get any good shots on the first two picks, the play can be run through
            again - just have the small forward kick it out to the point guard and run a pick with the center, and continue
            running it through until you get a good shot.</p>
