    <h1>Shooting Drills</h1>

    <p class="p1">No matter how great your defense is, or how hard your kids play, if you can't put the ball in the hole, you"ll have a
      tough time winning any games. Below are a selection of my favorite basketball shooting drills, including drills for
      perimeter players, drills for post players, and basic fundamentals for kids. Enjoy!</p>

    <h1>Stationary Basketball Shooting Form and Technique</h1>
    <p class="p1">In this section, we give you the raw form and mechanics of stationary shooting.
      <br> In other words, this section does NOT address the fundamentals of shooting on
      <br> the move and more advanced footwork you'll need for game situations. Here's
      <br> a quick roadmap of the stationary shooting fundamentals that we'll be covering:</p>

        <h2>EYES ON TARGET:</h2>
        <li>To improve accuracy, locate the target (rim) as early as possible.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="p1">
        <li>Keep your eyes on the target and do not follow the flight of the ball.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="p1">
        <li>Keeping your target focus is very important!</li>

    <ul class="p1">
    <h1>STANCE AND BALANCE:</h1>
    </ul>
    <ul class="p1">
      <li>Feet are shoulder width apart for good balance.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="p1">
      <li>Feet should be in a slightly staggered stance that is consistent and
        <br>comfortable for you. Your shooting foot is slightly ahead of the non-
        <br>shooting foot in a comfortable position.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="p1">
      <li>Point your feet in the general direction of the basket, but not necessarily
        <br> directly at it. We prefer an open stance, but you can also use the closed
        <br>(squared) stance if that's more comfortable for you. With an open stance,
        <br> your feet point towards one side of the basket. For example, a right handed
        <br> shooter will point his or her feet just to the left of the rim for a more natural
        <br> position and shooting motion.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="p1">
      <li>Once you develop a comfortable stance, line up your feet the exact same way
        <br>on every shot. Whatever stance you use, consistency is critical.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="p1">
      <li>Flex/bend your knees on every shot.</li>
    </ul>
