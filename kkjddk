      <h2>STANCE AND BALANCE :
      </h2>
      <li>Feet are shoulder width apart for good balance.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="p1">
      <li>
        Feet should be in a slightly staggered stance that is consistent and comfortable for you. Your shooting foot is slightly
        <ul class="p1">
        ahead of the non-shooting foot in a comfortable position.</li>
    </ul>
      <li>Point your feet in the general direction of the basket, but not necessarily directly at it. We prefer an open stance,
        but you can also use the closed (squared) stance if that's more comfortable for you. With an open stance, your feet
        point towards one side of the basket. For example, a right handed shooter will point his or her feet just to the
        left of the rim for a more natural position and shooting motion.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="p1">
      <li>Once you develop a comfortable stance, line up your feet the exact same way on every shot. Whatever stance you use,
        consistency is critical.</li>


    </ul>
    <ul class="p1">
      <li>Flex/bend your knees on every shot.</li>
    </ul>
