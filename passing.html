  <h1 style="float:left;">Passing Drills: </h1>
  <br>
  <br>

  <P style="color: orange; font-size: 20px">Your team’s ability to pass the ball accurately, using the correct technique will have a major impact on the flow and effectiveness
    of your offense.</P>
  <p style="color:orange;font-size: 20px">Spend time at every practice working on basketball passing drills. Teach your players each of the key passing techniques,
    and help them understand when and where to use each one.

  <h3>Two Hand Chest Pass</h3>
  <img src="pass.jpg" style="float: right;">
  <p style="color: orange; font-size: 20px">The advantage to putting both hands on the ball instead of just pushing it with one is that it allows more effective fakes.
    The passer can begin a pass, and if there’s overplay, and bring the ball back without releasing it. Since we’ve got full
    control with both hands this makes it much easier to fake the chest pass and hit a player on a backdoor cut right after.</p>

  <h3>Over Head Pass</h3>
  <img src="pass1.png" style="float:right;">
  <p style="color: orange;font-size: 20px">Another useful passing technique is the over the head pass, or lob pass, which is also useful as a post entry. If the post
    defender is playing on the high side, and the passer has the ball on the wing, we can lead and direct our post player
    to the basket. We’ll try to throw to the inside of the backboard on set plays, which allows the big man to catch the
    ball high, keep it up over his head, and finish strong without getting stripped.</p>

  <h3>Bounce Pass</h3>
  <img src="pass2.png" style="float: right;">
  <p style="color: orange;font-size: 20px">The bounce pass will be your most common technique for post entry, especially if the post player has his defender sealed
    behind him. It allows your player to hold off his defender while receiving the pass low, with much less risk of the ball
    being tipped or intercepted. On the perimeter, the bounce pass can also be used if your wing player is outside being
    over played on the wing. He can come out to the ball, and if denied, make a quick backdoor cut, receive the bounce pass
    in stride and score the layup.</p>
